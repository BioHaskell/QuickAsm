 SPARTA+: Shifts Prediction from Analogue in Residue type and
          Torsion Angles by a neural network.

 The SPARTA+ System predicts protein backbone chemical shifts
 from structure and sequence homology using a neural network.
 It will predict shifts for HN HA N CA CB and C' atoms in a
 protein structure when given a PDB file as input.

 Optionally, if a table of observed chemical shifts is given,
 SPARTA+ will compare its predictions with the given measured
 shifts. The input table of observed chemical shifts should
 be in the format used by the TALOS+ system for prediction of
 protein backbone torsion angles.

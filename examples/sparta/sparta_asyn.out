Analysis of Observed vs Predicted Shifts:

 Notice: the Average of prediction errors for atom type N is larger than
         expected.  The input table of observed chemical shifts require an
         offset correction.

         Std Dev of prediction error for  N shifts:  3.673 ppm
         Average of prediction error for  N shifts: -4.141 ppm
         Expected Limit:  0.673 ppm (3*3.673/sqrt(n))


 Notice: the Average of prediction errors for atom type C is larger than
         expected.  The input table of observed chemical shifts require an
         offset correction.

         Std Dev of prediction error for  C shifts:  1.202 ppm
         Average of prediction error for  C shifts:  1.610 ppm
         Expected Limit:  0.226 ppm (3*1.202/sqrt(n))


 Notice: the Average of prediction errors for atom type CA is larger than
         expected.  The input table of observed chemical shifts require an
         offset correction.

         Std Dev of prediction error for CA shifts:  1.639 ppm
         Average of prediction error for CA shifts:  1.001 ppm
         Expected Limit:  0.295 ppm (3*1.639/sqrt(n))


 Notice: the Average of prediction errors for atom type CB is larger than
         expected.  The input table of observed chemical shifts require an
         offset correction.

         Std Dev of prediction error for CB shifts:  1.788 ppm
         Average of prediction error for CB shifts: -1.911 ppm
         Expected Limit:  0.367 ppm (3*1.788/sqrt(n))

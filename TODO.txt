For computing asyn:
1. Action to repeat model, and distinguish linker.
2. MMC sampling.
Optional:
3. Planarity restraint for NH. (Absolute value of a dot product with vector perpendicular to the plane?)
4. Plane shift restraint. (one coordinate strictly higher between polymers.)
5. SPARTA restraints as a guide? 
6. Accurate chem shift prediction may need rotamer reconstruction using SCWRL.
7. ShiftX requires 1.8s instead of ~9s that SPARTA+ needs for asyn polymer. But also needs a different output parser.
BATCH mode: ./shiftx 1A input.pdb output.shiftx

Profile reconstruct test.
String -> ByteString

Add test for StericClash that shows something :-)

Scoring 832 models took 1m24s (1m21 user time.)
Among these parsing took 33s.
